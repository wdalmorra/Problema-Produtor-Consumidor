Why is Git always asking for my password?

If Git prompts you for a username and password every time 
you try to interact with GitHub, you're probably using the 
HTTPS clone URL for your repository.

Using an HTTPS remote URL has some advantages:
it's easier to set up than SSH, and usually works through
strict firewalls and proxies. However, it also prompts
you to enter your GitHub credentials every time you 
pull or push a repository.

You can configure Git to store your password for you. 
If you'd like to set that up,
